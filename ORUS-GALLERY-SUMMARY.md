## Philosophy & Vision

### Core Concept: "Origin + Us"
ORUS Gallery emerges from a profound conviction that art transcends borders, cultures, and time. The name embodies the gallery's mission to connect origins (artistic heritage, memory, identity) with "us" (collectors, communities, the present moment).

### Curatorial Approach
- **Continuity over speed** - Deep engagement with each artist rather than rapid turnover
- **Depth over breadth** - Quality representation focused on artists with singular voices
- **Memory and Identity** - Artists whose work explores the human condition, heritage, and contemporary experience
- **Cultural bridges** - Connecting Western contemporary art with Asian collectors

### Market Position
- High-end contemporary art gallery
- Focus on international artists (primarily Western and American)
- Target collectors: Asian and global
- Pre-launch phase (no physical space yet)
