# ORUS Gallery Website Optimization Brainstorm

Based on the gallery's philosophy of "Origin + Us," curatorial approach, and market positioning, here are strategic recommendations to elevate the website.

---

## 1. Hero Section Enhancements

### Current State
- Logo, name, and Taiwan-Paris tagline
- Basic scroll indicator

### Recommendations

**A. Immersive Entry Experience**
- Add subtle parallax effect on the logo
- Consider a brief (3-4 second) logo reveal animation that draws the eye
- Add atmospheric ambient gradient that shifts subtly

**B. Statement Piece**
- Feature a rotating "Featured Work" behind the logo (blurred, atmospheric)
- This hints at the gallery's artists without overshadowing the brand

**C. Scroll Prompt**
- Replace simple line with an elegant gold "Discover" text that fades on scroll
- Or use Chinese characters for cultural depth: "探索" (Explore)

### Recommendations

**A. Visual Storytelling**

**B. Quote Integration**

CONTINUITY over speed
DEPTH over breadth
MEMORY in motion

```
- Display as animated typography that reveals on scroll
